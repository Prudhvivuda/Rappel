This folder `project_discovery_iterations` is based on the previous notebooks contributed by James Kunstle in [project_discovery](../../project_discovery).

- The respositories that are used for the analysis are [here](../ai_repos.json).
- repo_discovery in this folder is based on the notebook [repo_discovery](../../project_discovery/repo_discovery/repo_discovery.ipynb).
- top_page_rank_common_repos in this folder is based on the notebook [top_page_rank_common_repos](../../project_discovery/pagerank_top_repos/top_pagerank_common_repos.ipynb).
  

## Why?
The main goal to iterate on the listed notebooks is to perform similar analysis on the AI/ML repositories to find new repositories and rank them based on page rank algorithm.
